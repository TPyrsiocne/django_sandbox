this app is intended to be a sandbox to play with many to many relationships between a model and itself.

the model will be called Node and the relationship will be through Edge.

This can be though of as a graph.
Since the ManyToManyField setting 'symetrical' is set to false
this can be though of as a directed graph.

Fields in Edge hold information associated with the edeges of the graph
Fields in Node hold information associated with the nodes.
