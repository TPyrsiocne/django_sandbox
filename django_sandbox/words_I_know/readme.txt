words_I_know
this app is intended to be an exploration of django user management.

intended functionality:

the app will store a global dictionary of words.
Users can create accounts with their own password and login name.

the user can then see a list of all words in the app.
users can click on a word to see it's definition and select whether they know it or not.
the index page with the list of all words will then indicate/mark known words differently than unknown words.

a user can add new words with their difinitions to the dictionary which will then be globaly available.




====internals====
there will be a global words table with all the words in the system.
